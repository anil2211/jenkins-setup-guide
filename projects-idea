🔥 DevOps + Agentic AI
5 End-to-End Projects to Crack MNC Jobs (3–5x Hike)


📌 Why These Projects Matter
Most candidates build:

Simple CI/CD pipelines
Basic Kubernetes deployments
Top MNCs expect more.
These projects prove:

Real production thinking
Platform & SRE mindset
AI + DevOps (Agentic, not ChatGPT wrappers)

🚀 PROJECT 1
Agentic AI–Driven Self-Healing CI/CD Platform
🎯 Problem
CI/CD failures waste engineering hours and slow releases.

🧠 Agentic AI Idea
Pipelines debug, fix, and retry themselves using AI agents.

🛠 Tech Stack
GitHub Actions / Jenkins
Docker, Kubernetes
Terraform
OpenTelemetry
LLM + Vector DB
Slack Bot
🔁 End-to-End Steps
Build CI pipeline: build → test → scan → deploy
Stream logs & metrics centrally
Store historical failures as embeddings
AI agent:
Reads logs
Detects failure pattern
Suggests fix (config/code)
Auto-open PR or retry pipeline
Slack approval before prod deploy
GitOps sync to Kubernetes
💼 Resume Line
Built an AI-powered self-healing CI/CD platform reducing pipeline failures by 60%


🚀 PROJECT 2
AI-Based Kubernetes Cost Optimization & Auto-Scaling System
🎯 Problem
Over-provisioned clusters silently burn cloud money.

🧠 Agentic AI Idea
AI predicts load and dynamically optimizes scaling.

🛠 Tech Stack
Kubernetes
Prometheus + Grafana
HPA / KEDA
Python
LLM + Forecasting
🔁 End-to-End Steps
Deploy microservices on Kubernetes
Collect CPU, memory, traffic metrics
Train time-series prediction model
AI agent forecasts demand
Auto-tunes HPA/KEDA rules
Validate cost savings via dashboards
Rollback if SLA risk detected
💼 Resume Line
Reduced Kubernetes cloud cost by 40% using AI-driven auto-scaling


🚀 PROJECT 3
Autonomous Cloud Incident Response (AI SRE Project)
🎯 Problem
Manual incident response increases MTTR.

🧠 Agentic AI Idea
AI detects incidents, executes runbooks, writes postmortems.

🛠 Tech Stack
CloudWatch / Prometheus
ELK Stack
Terraform
Slack
LLM
🔁 End-to-End Steps
Create fault-injected microservices
Configure alerts for latency & errors
AI detects anomaly
Diagnoses root cause
Executes fix:
Rollback
Restart
Scale
Notifies team in Slack
Auto-generates RCA
💼 Resume Line
Built an AI-driven incident response system cutting MTTR by 50%


🚀 PROJECT 4
AI-Powered DevSecOps Auto-Remediation Platform
🎯 Problem
Security issues are detected but not fixed fast.

🧠 Agentic AI Idea
AI fixes vulnerabilities instead of just reporting them.

🛠 Tech Stack
Trivy / Snyk
Docker
Kubernetes
GitHub Actions
OPA
LLM
🔁 End-to-End Steps
Scan code & images in CI
AI parses CVEs
Prioritizes by severity
Suggests fixes (base image, patches)
Auto-creates PR
Enforces policy gates
Blocks unsafe prod deploys
💼 Resume Line
Implemented AI-assisted DevSecOps with auto-remediation of CVEs


🚀 PROJECT 5
Internal Developer Platform with AI DevOps Assistant
🎯 Problem
Developers depend on DevOps for everything.

🧠 Agentic AI Idea
Self-service platform + AI DevOps assistant.

🛠 Tech Stack
Backstage
Kubernetes
Terraform
GitOps
LLM + RAG
🔁 End-to-End Steps
Build internal developer portal
Self-service app creation & infra provisioning
GitOps-based deployments
AI chatbot answers:
Why build failed
How to fix deployments
Governance & RBAC
Cost & performance dashboards
💼 Resume Line
Built an AI-enabled Internal Developer Platform improving developer velocity


🧠 How to Explain These in Interviews
For every project, prepare:

Architecture diagram
Failure scenarios
AI agent decision flow
Trade-offs & limitations
How it scales to 100+ services

🔑 Pro Tip for 400% Hike
One deep, well-explained project beats five shallow ones.
