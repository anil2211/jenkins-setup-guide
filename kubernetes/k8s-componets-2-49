Kubernetes Components
CONTROL PLANE (Master Node / Brain)
The control plane makes decisions and manages the cluster state.
It does not run application containers.
1️⃣ API Server
Definition
The API Server is the central entry point of the Kubernetes cluster that handles all requests and communication.
Explanation
All commands (kubectl, CI/CD, UI, controllers) go through API Server
Validates requests
Updates or reads cluster state from etcd
Acts as a hub between all components

📌 Key Point
If API Server is down → cluster is unusable

2️⃣ Scheduler
Definition
The Scheduler decides which worker node a Pod should run on.
Explanation
Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node
Evaluates:
CPU & memory availability
Node health
Constraints & policies
Assigns Pod to the best node
📌 Key Point
Scheduler does placement, not execution

3️⃣ Controller Manager
Definition
The Controller Manager ensures the desired state matches the actual state of the cluster.
Explanation
Continuously monitors cluster
If something breaks → fixes it automatically
Examples:
Pod dies → new Pod created
Node fails → Pods rescheduled
Replicas < desired → create more
📌 Key Point
This is where self-healing comes from

4️⃣ etcd
Definition
etcd is a distributed key-value database that stores the entire cluster state.
Explanation
Stores:
Nodes
Pods
Secrets
ConfigMaps
Desired state
Highly consistent & reliable
Single source of truth
📌 Key Point
If etcd data is lost → cluster state is lost

WORKER NODE (Execution Layer)
Worker nodes run application workloads.
5️⃣ kubelet
Definition
The kubelet is a node-level agent that executes instructions from the control plane.
Explanation
Communicates with API Server
Ensures containers described in Pod spec are running
Monitors Pod & container health
Reports node status back to control plane
✔ Acts as:
Agent
Executor of the brain
Caretaker of the node
📌 Key Point
kubelet does NOT decide — it executes

6️⃣ kube-proxy (Service Proxy)
Definition
kube-proxy manages network communication and basic load balancing for Services.
Explanation
Runs on every worker node
Handles:
Pod-to-Pod communication
Service-to-Pod routing
Uses iptables / IPVS
Provides stable access to Pods
📌 Key Point
kube-proxy enables service-level load balancing, not application LB

7️⃣ Container Runtime
Definition
The container runtime is the software that actually runs containers.
Explanation
Examples:
Docker
containerd
CRI-O
Pulls images
Creates containers
Starts and stops containers
📌 Key Point
Kubernetes does not run containers itself
It instructs the container runtime


CLIENT TOOL (NOT PART OF NODE)

8️⃣ kubectl (Corrected)
Definition
kubectl is a command-line client tool used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
Explanation
Sends requests to API Server
Can be run from:
Laptop
CI/CD server
Bastion host
❌ Not part of master or worker
✔ Only communicates through API Server
📌 Key Point
kubectl = CLI interface, NOT a cluster component

NETWORKING
9️⃣ CNI (Container Network Interface)
Definition
CNI is a networking plugin framework that provides network connectivity to Pods.
Explanation
Ensures:
Every Pod gets a unique IP
Pod-to-Pod communication across nodes
Examples:
Calico
Flannel
Weave
Installed by default in managed clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS)
📌 Key Point
Without CNI → Pods cannot communicate



kubectl
   ↓
API Server
   ↓
Scheduler → Node Selection
Controller Manager → State Reconciliation
   ↓
etcd (Cluster Memory)
   ↓
kubelet → container runtime → containers
   ↓
kube-proxy + CNI → networking
